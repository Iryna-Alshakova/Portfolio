# Survival Probability after a Heart Attack
The dataset was uploaded from https://www.kaggle.com/yukikitayama/survival-analysis/data

Herein we perform survival analysis on the dataset containing information obtained from patients' echocardiogram. 
Analysis will predict the number of month the person will most likely live after a heart attack.

### Conclusions
* From the collected data one can conclude that the survival probability is maximum during the first 10 months after a heart attack, 
then it starts to decrease gradualy and reaches its minimum after 50 month.
* Further the survival probability was estimated by several different groups. 
* Thus, patients who were assigned to the group 1 have higher survival probability after 30 months than those who were assigned to the group 2. 
* Patients younger than 62 have a bit higher survival probability during the first 25 month. It decreases dramaticaly between 25 and 40 months. 
* Patients with wallmotion index higher than average have in general a lightly lower survival probability.
* Because the number of samples is quite small, as a general suggestion, more data should be collected to make more accurate estimation.

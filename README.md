*September 2014 - April 2019*   
##### Graduate Research Assistant, Brock University, St. Catharines, ON, Canada   
•	Designed, synthesized pyrazolyl-phosphine and pyrazolyl-sulfide ligands for ruthenium and zinc complexes. Applied the obtained complexes in catalytic transfer hydrogenation and hydrosilylation of a wide range of substrates, e.g. carbonyls, nitriles, heterocyclic compounds, olefins, alkynes, and esters: design of experiments, optimization of catalytic reaction conditions, characterization of products with NMR spectroscopy, HPLC- and LC/GC-MS, IR spectroscopy, polarimetry. Performed mechanistic and kinetic studies of the developed catalytic processes.  
• Drafted manuscripts for submission to peer-review journals and presented research findings at international conferences.   
•	Assisted in supervising of the 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-year laboratory practicum.  

*September 2012 - May 2014*   
##### Undergraduate Research Assistant, National Academy of Science of Belarus, Minsk, Belarus 
•	Developed the efficient synthesis of brassinosteroids - biologically active compounds, that are of great importance in the agricultural field.    
•	Adaptated the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation to the synthesis of functionalized brassinosteroids.  

*September 2011 -May 2012*	
##### Undergraduate Research Assistant, Department of Chemistry, Belarusian State University, Minsk, Belarus
•	Analyzed honey and alcoholic beverages by GC-MS and HPLC methods.
